# Blog-DB-Console-App-with-EntityFrameworkCore-on-Mac
I made a blog DB consol app on Mac with EntityFrameworkCore, MSSQL, Azure Data Studio, Docker etc.
I used 5 NuGet Packages also for it, one was the EntityFrameworkCore.
The Visual Studio on Mac hasn't got MSSQL tool so I had to figure out how to make it. It's fortunatly succeeded. I'm happy and proud of myself.ðŸ˜Ž
I had download few packages for make it workable. I used also for it brew, and npm.

I made a mistake I named it phonebook app in the beginning, but it's false. Its a blog app!
